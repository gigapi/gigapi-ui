This is a very well-structured and documented project. The `DASHBOARD.md` file provides an exceptionally clear overview of the architecture and vision. Based on that document and a review of the codebase, here are my observations.

### Overall Analysis

The project is in a strong position. It's built on a modern stack (Vite, React, TypeScript) with a solid, Grafana-inspired architecture. The commitment to TypeScript, clean code, and a robust data processing pipeline is evident. The existing `DASHBOARD.md` serves as an excellent architectural guide.

The primary areas for improvement are not in the core functionality, which seems complete, but in ensuring long-term maintainability, stability, and developer experience through automated testing, dependency management, and process refinement.

### Key Strengths

*   **Excellent Architecture**: The Grafana-inspired model with a clear separation of concerns (data transformation, panel rendering, state management) is robust and scalable.
*   **TypeScript First**: The commitment to full type safety (`zero TS errors`) is a significant asset for maintainability.
*   **Modern UI Components**: The use of `shadcn/ui` (inferred from `components.json` and the `src/components/ui` structure) provides a modern, accessible, and themeable component library.
*   **Detailed Vision**: The `DASHBOARD.md` file outlines a comprehensive and well-thought-out roadmap.

### Immediate Pain Points & Actionable Issues

1.  **Duplicate Package Lockfiles**: The repository contains both `bun.lock` and `package-lock.json`. This indicates that both `bun` and `npm` have been used to manage dependencies, which can lead to inconsistencies and "works on my machine" issues.
    *   **Recommendation**: Standardize on one package manager. Given the presence of `bun_ci.yml`, `bun` appears to be the intended choice. The `package-lock.json` file should be deleted, and the team should commit to using only `bun` for all dependency management. The `npm_push.yaml` workflow should also be converted to use `bun`.

2.  **Duplicate Component File**: There are two `MCPConnectionSheet.tsx` files:
    *   `src/components/MCPConnectionSheet.tsx`
    *   `src/components/MCP/MCPConnectionSheet.tsx`
    *   **Recommendation**: This is likely a remnant of refactoring. One of them is redundant and should be removed to avoid confusion and bugs.

3.  **Potentially Unused CSS**: The file `src/loader.css` exists. Its styles could likely be merged into `index.css` or handled directly within the `Loader.tsx` component for better encapsulation, reducing the number of global stylesheets.

### Potential Enhancements & Strategic Recommendations

1.  **Automated Testing**: This is the most critical missing piece. The `DASHBOARD.md` mentions manual testing but acknowledges the need for an automated suite.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a testing strategy using `vitest`. It integrates seamlessly with Vite and can be used for unit, integration, and component testing. Start by testing critical data transformation functions in `src/lib/` and then move to component testing. Add a CI step to run tests on every pull request.

2.  **State Management**: The project uses multiple React Contexts. While this is effective for separating concerns, it can lead to "context hell" with deeply nested providers and potential performance issues from excessive re-renders.
    *   **Recommendation**: For now, this is not an urgent issue. However, as the application grows, consider adopting a more centralized and optimized state management library like `Zustand`. It's lightweight, has a minimal API, and avoids the provider nesting issue.

3.  **Actionable Project Management**: The roadmap in `DASHBOARD.md` is fantastic but not easily trackable.
    *   **Recommendation**: Convert the "Next Steps & Roadmap" section into GitHub Issues. This makes the work actionable, assignable, and allows for progress tracking. The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file can then be updated to direct contributors to the issues tab.

4.  **CI/CD Refinement**: The GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows`) show a good start on automation but have conflicting standards.
    *   **Recommendation**: Consolidate the workflows. Ensure all CI jobs use `bun` instead of `npm`. Add jobs for linting (`eslint .`) and running the future test suite (`bun test`).

### Summary of Files to Review/Remove

*   `package-lock.json`: Should be removed in favor of `bun.lock`.
*   `src/components/MCPConnectionSheet.tsx` or `src/components/MCP/MCPConnectionSheet.tsx`: One of these is likely redundant.
*   `src/loader.css`: Consider merging and removing.
*   `public/logo.svg` vs `src/assets/logo.svg`: Verify if both are necessary or if one can be consolidated. (This is a minor point).
*   `.github/workflows/npm_push.yaml`: Should be reviewed and likely converted to a `bun`-based workflow or removed if redundant.

### Deeper Analysis: Dashboard & Query System

A detailed review of the dashboard and query processing systems reveals a robust and modern architecture. The following are opportunities for refinement to enhance scalability, reduce complexity, and improve maintainability.

#### 1. Unify Query Processing Logic

*   **Observation**: There are two separate time-based query processors: a simple one in `lib/query-processor.ts` and a more advanced one in `lib/dashboard/query-processing.ts`. This leads to code duplication and potential inconsistencies between the panel editor and the live dashboard.
*   **Recommendation**:
    *   **Deprecate `lib/query-processor.ts`**.
    *   **Consolidate all time interpolation logic into `lib/dashboard/query-processing.ts`**. This file should be the single source of truth for handling `$__timeFilter`, `$__interval`, and other Grafana-style variables.
    *   Refactor `PanelEdit.tsx` and `DashboardContext.tsx` to use this unified processor, ensuring consistent query generation everywhere.

#### 2. Centralize Schema and Data Analysis

*   **Observation**: Logic for analyzing data types, detecting smart field defaults (`xField`, `yField`), and transforming data is spread between `data-transformers.ts` and `PanelEdit.tsx`.
*   **Recommendation**:
    *   **Create a central `SchemaAnalyzer` utility** within the `lib/dashboard/` directory.
    *   This utility should encapsulate all functions related to field type analysis, smart defaults, and data structure detection.
    *   Refactor `PanelEdit.tsx` to consume this utility, simplifying the component and centralizing the core data analysis logic.

#### 3. Refine State Management and Data Flow

*   **Observation**: `DashboardContext.tsx` is very large, and the panel data refresh logic is spread across multiple functions.
*   **Recommendation**:
    *   **Simplify Refresh Logic**: Consolidate the multiple `refreshPanel...` functions into a single, more flexible `refreshPanel` function that can accept an optional `timeRange` override.
    *   **(Future) Consider Context Splitting**: If the application continues to grow, consider splitting the monolithic `DashboardContext` into smaller, more focused contexts (e.g., `DashboardMetaContext`, `DashboardPanelContext`, `DashboardDataContext`) to improve performance and maintainability.

#### 4. Files to Modify/Delete

*   **DELETE**: `lib/query-processor.ts` (after its logic is merged).
*   **MODIFY**:
    *   `lib/dashboard/query-processing.ts`: To become the single, unified query processor.
    *   `lib/dashboard/data-transformers.ts`: To use the new `SchemaAnalyzer` utility.
    *   `src/contexts/DashboardContext.tsx`: To use the unified query processor and simplified refresh logic.
    *   `src/pages/PanelEdit.tsx`: To use the unified query processor and the `SchemaAnalyzer` utility.
